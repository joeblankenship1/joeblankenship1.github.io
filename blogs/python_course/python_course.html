                    <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                    <blockquote>“There is no way I can teach this to someone else; I don’t even know if I know this good enough myself!”</blockquote>
                    <p>This is what goes through my head every time I talk to anyone who wants to know what I know. Whether this is related to academic work, open-source projects, or occupational tasks, there is always the fear of being called an impostor. Even though I know I can accomplish the things they ask about, for some reason it’s hard for me to translate my scattered mental constructs into an easy-to-understand set of instructions for others. However, over the years I’ve found a few surefire ways of overcoming this self-intimidation among my peers and students: training to teaching.</p>
                    <p>Training to teach a subject is the best way that I’ve found to learn a subject. For me, teaching what I know is grounded in my desire to learn something and to retain that knowledge. So that is the approach I tend to take when creating a course or preparing to learn a new skill: I learn as if I’m going to become the “expert” in that area of knowledge.</p>
                    <p>I’ve always loved using the Python programming language. I started using it as part of my work with GIS and spatial analysis in GUI-based tools like ArcGIS and later QGIS. However, it wasn’t until I started doing batch data operations and more complex spatial analysis that I started to really learn the utility of the Python libraries that these GUIs used in the background. Over the years, I became very good as knowing how I use Python to get things done, but not so great as telling others how I did those things.</p>
                    <p>Fast forward a little over a decade, I’m on my second round of teaching a <a href="https://github.com/bluegrass-devs/python_immersion" target="_blank">Python for Data Science course</a> to my local Meetup groups and my academic colleagues. Through the iterative processes of going through materials and then meeting with co-learners to go over the materials, I’ve not only found a way to retain my knowledge, but several ways to help others understand those same concepts. What follows are my biggest takeaways from this process.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Basics</h2>
                    <p>The biggest thing to remember as someone with experience: the basics for you are not the basics for a newcomer. You as the teacher and co-learner have to understand that in order to help a newcomer build their foundation, you have to learn how you built yours. No two developers or data analysts think the same nor will they work in the same ways. So how do I effectively help someone learn things that have become intuitive to me as a researcher and data geek?</p>
                    <p>First and foremost: slow down. One thing I’ve learned in teaching is to take time to watch people working through the foundational concepts in Python. This way, you ensure they fully understand not only what they are seeing, but that they can apply those concepts to their Python paradigm (e.g., the reasons and use-cases they started learning Python for in the first place). Ask questions and make sure exercises and demos are placed in the right spots as to now overload their ability to learn Python as a cumulative process (e.g., they are learning Python in a manner that connects basic elements into more complex concepts). You’re their guide through this process, so it’s important not to lose them in the maze of your own thoughts.</p>
                    <p>Also keep in mind that you may not know everything about Python and that is fine so long as you know what you know correctly. If you approach teaching as a process of co-learning, you and the student get to explore the subject together. This does a couple of really interesting things. First, it lets them know that even experienced people are constantly learning. Secondly, you both get to have a shared learning experience that helps them learn problem-solving techniques and social practices in a working environment. These wouldn’t seem to be key skills to learn in a coding class, but they often prove critical in interviews and workplaces where working as a team requires a self-reliant person with effective social decorum to ensure tasks are understood fully and accomplished on time.</p>
                    <p>Keeping the above points in mind, it is important to start small and build in a way that best suits the students (and in some cases yourself). It is okay to build a very ambitious curriculum for a class, but if you’re losing students you have to take a step back and ask why. Flexibility and reflection are critical in teaching as it can help you and the students to meet common goals and more importantly, mutually-shared small victories. Building a simple hello world script may not seem very huge to a teacher, but that may be just what a student needs to say, “I can do this, what’s next!” This means having a course modular enough to adjust direction with scenarios that help them understand how small pieces build towards a bigger picture.</p>
