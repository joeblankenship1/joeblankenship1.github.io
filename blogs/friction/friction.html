                    <p>The building was almost empty. Every step echoed as I approached the ticket counter of this transportation mausoleum. That is not to say this place was without some antique charm, but that their was an absence of life in the space of the station. My attempt at conversation with the security guard was met with a general malaise and the thud of my bag upon the wooden bench was last notable sound for an hour as I waited. The space itself was quite nice. Vaulted ceilings set with fine decorations held high with Ionic column facades. The Florida humidity had worked long on the plaster and paint which was showing its age. The lovely wooden benches were spread around the polished floor of which the security guard and myself were the sole observers. Then one by one, people started to enter the building. The sounds of luggage wheels, the chatter of people checking-in with the attendants, similar thuds as heard before, and then silence. People staring at smartphones, a look up and around, and then back to their smartphones.</p>
                    <p>And then coughs...</p>
                    <p>Like a bevy of deer alerted to the presence of a predator, people snapped to attention and looked for others to validate their concerns. A similar event occurred when the train was delayed coming into the station: looks of anguish and resignation abound.</p>
                    <blockquote>We as members of a society, as citizens of a state, have increasingly failed to foster communication. Observing these people, I realized that despite the increasing number of communication apps and devices we frequently fail to truly convey meaningful content and then actively listen to one another. In the current moment, COVID-19 is on everyone’s minds, but perhaps this is not the most pressing pandemic we are experiencing. Perhaps it’s this societal sickness, our social quarantine, that will ultimately be our undoing.</blockquote>
                    <p>Boarding the train was standard fare: lines of people just looking to get situated and in their seats. A mother wrangled her child onto the train while an elderly couple slowly edged in front of me to engage with the conductor. I headed to the cafe car to setup for a little work and to get some coffee while the rest of the passengers boarded. Several passengers hovered around for the vendor to serve drinks and food, barely interacting with each other as they were consumed by their singular thoughts. I eventually got my coffee and started to write. Others scattered around me at their tables, eating quietly as they looked upon the moving landscape out their windows.</p>
                    <blockquote>When the news media uses words, those words have a powerful effect. Despite the many definitions of news, this is in fact the news media’s job: to use words as a way to convey content and its meaning to listeners. The providers of news media often utilize key words so often that they move from efficacy into incredulity, leaving many in states of ambiguous mobilization or social paralysis. This often results in a state of disbelief by listeners which ultimately puts them in real danger. This ability to quickly compress the hype cycle of a given event, further exacerbated by social media outlets, produces a cumulative effect of simulacra-based confusion. This has been the case with the word pandemic and it will be the case in the future without critical change to discourse and its subsequent engagement.</blockquote>
