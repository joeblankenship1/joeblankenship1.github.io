                    <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>How do you know what something is? How do we know if something is something and not something else? What is a thing?</p>
                    <p>Thousands of years after philosophers began to define the world around us, we still seek to explain and contextualize our lives and the places in which we live them. In recent decades, this process of definition involves massive amounts of data across dozens of information systems. These systems contain hundreds of representations: people, organizations, human and physical processes, and many more things. Ergo, the need to consolidate trillions of records across information systems is paramount for understanding the world of things around us: how representations are captured and how people make decisions based on these representations.</p>
                    <p>What follows is my experience thus far with these challenges and a few lessons learned from using an upper- or top-level ontology to structure and consolidate knowledge for machine learning.</p>
                    <blockquote>Note: I interchangeably use upper-level ontology (ULO) and top-level ontology (TLO). ISO refers to Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as a TLO, but BFO's official book refers to itself as a ULO. So for this blog post, they are the same thing.</blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Of Machine Minds and Human Madness</h2>
                    <p>Back to the original set of questions: after being assigned to work on knowledge graphs, I spent the majority of 2020 and 2021 researching knowledge engineering and data engineering to support this effort. Whether it was property graphs or hypergraphs, every implementation came with challenges. Leveraging data dictionaries and consolidated schemas failed to meet modeling requirements for disparate data sets. Additionally, a massive effort to modernize data management and governance paralleled these efforts as knowledge graph models require several different considerations such as data type and additional object logic. This array of challenges drove me to seek out upper-level (e.g., top-level) ontologies such as BFO.</p>
                    <p>The use of an upper-level ontology was ultimately the solution I chose. This choice was due to several considerations. The most important consideration and a challenge experienced by many data scientists and artificial intelligence (AI) engineers were this:</p>
                    <blockquote>Humans do not want artificial intelligence (AI). Humans want machines that replicate useful aspects of human intelligence.</blockquote>
                    <p>So how do you teach the equivalent of a speechless child to perform adult human tasks? One solution is to throw computational power and validated models at a problem to calculate solutions as quickly as possible. The other is to give the child the equivalent of adult heuristics to attempt to make adult-like shortcuts to answers. The drive to provide AI with shortcuts is why developing ontology right is crucial while simultaneously being extremely difficult.</p>
                    <p>My research on <a href="https://basic-formal-ontology.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)</a> helped me overcome several misunderstandings. I was unaware that in addition to being an <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/74572.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">international standard certified by the ISO</a>, BFO established consistent, positive results in the medical and biological research spaces over the decades of its existence. These results included an accelerated research cycle for critical biomedical breakthroughs and building a culture to evolve the standard to new areas over the years. This use of a top-level rule system for building an upper-level ontology is preferable to a great ontology such as DBpedia or YAGO for several reasons, the biggest of which is that a customer rarely wants to maintain the contents of Wikipedia in their knowledge and data management systems. A customer ultimately wants to access their own essential knowledge quickly to iterate on decision-making heuristics. This clarification on knowledge graph requirements allows engineers and scientists to leverage machine learning for rapid iteration on models that best reflects the essential domain knowledge. Customers can then focus on the right questions and the most accurate scope for a decision.</p>
                    <p>This ontology system's history also proved helpful in my initial challenges. First, humans misuse words all the time. Specific and accurate language is critical for producing useful metrics when gathering data or engineering requirements. Additionally, when humans use the same words, they often use different implicit definitions. So not only must engineers monitor for consistency of word utilization, but they also have to monitor context. Next, human thoughts are rarely simple streams of logic, often emerging as spurts of rationale and circuitous statements that eventually provide a partial picture. So the engineer must consolidate multiple contexts into sets based on the words and their associated definitions. Finally (at least for this blog post), the engineer must ensure additional requirements or different projects do not shift words, definitions, or context sets. If there is a shift, provenance and legacy must be traceable within the ontology and the data artifacts connected to the ontology objects.</p>
                    <p>So not easy. Not easy at all.</p>
                    <p>The remainder of this blog will focus on a few of my biggest lessons learned for data engineering knowledge graphs using an adapted ULO.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Words Don't Matter. Situated Meaning Does.</h2>
                    <p>It is beyond frustrating when requirements shift because an engineer allegedly "did not understand what" a customer "meant." The "what" here is a "word" that is a "thing" and a "thing" should be (at a minimum) unique within the context of the requirements discussion. Optimally, a word should "mean" the same thing throughout an organization, but this rarely, if ever, happens: this disconnect even happens between desks within established data teams. Furthermore, a new data set or a new fiscal year's vision may drastically shift a customer's essential domain knowledge dimensions. So the challenge is to establish clear language used and tracked consistently within the customer's knowledge development.</p>
                    <p>This problematic is where a ULO is extremely useful. To obtain this common knowledge development, an organization must agree to consistently structure their language on essential dimensions within knowledge and data management systems. After establishing the scheme that best fits a set of requirements, there may be an urge to jump straight into processing the data to fit a selected machine learning model. This course of action may skip essential steps such as characterizing the data within a metadata metamodel, mapping schema to a lineage of schemata, or expanding on the provenance of the data within a content management system. An ontology forces the engineer to align each data dimension to common "things" or terms. Common terms are the foundation of common understanding for an organization's decision-making models.</p>
                    <p>Once common terms are established and consistently used, there is still the challenge of knowing which things are which when one thing may be similar to another thing. A boat is a vessel that floats on water. A dingy is a boat that is small. A dingy is both a boat and a vessel, but the manner in which we distinguish these three terms is through structured definitions, which create hierarchical relationships between things and other things that are very similar. This "very similar" condition is often a single dimension of difference, allowing several branches to emerge from a common term that expands the typology and dimensionality of higher-level, more general things in the ontology. As a result, the data set features, or instances, connected to the ontology terms inherit this hierarchical structure.</p>
                    <p>So to recap:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Term is just a distinct word for a common thing</li>
                        <li>Definition is the term and its distinct description</li>
                        <li>Hierarchy places the term and its definition into a tree which demonstrates inheritance between terms and their definitions starting with a universal "thing"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <a href="img/ontology_basic.jpg">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/ontology_basic.jpg" alt="Oops!">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Ontology - Fundamental Elements</span>
                    <p>So a data dictionary is great for knowing how to define common terms, but an upper-level ontology can elevate your definitions to essential domain knowledge. Regardless of the system you choose, this ontology must be your ontology for all your things across all your data. We'll discuss this more in the next section.</p>
                    <blockquote>Note: The universal "thing" is the term "Thing" which is a general Aristotelian starting point for an ontology, later used in the works of Linnaeus on taxonomy. As a result, BFO uses Aristotelian definitions to create the hierarchy for things in their ULO. This is later inherited by instances of the ULO things to which the data is mapped.</blockquote>
