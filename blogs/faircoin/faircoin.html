                    <p>My initial research into cryptocurrencies and blockchains primarily focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum, two very successful blockchain systems that have set many standards for subsequent blockchain technologies. However, both of these are experiencing emergent issues of block scale and increasingly consumptive consensus protocols which have yet to find broadly accepted community-wide solutions.</p>
                    <p>FairCoin is an alt-coin initially based on the Bitcoin protocol which has been adopted by the FairCoop project, a globally open and self-organized, online effort to overcome economic and social inequality outside of nation-state control. FairCoin acts as the tokenized store-of-value for this economic and ideological system which embraces the potential of peer-to-peer (P2P) society, hacker ethics, integral revolution, justice, and solidarity for people, their ideas, and their labor.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">FairCoin at a Glance</h2>
                    <p>According to the FairCoin 2.0 white paper, the newest version of the cryptocurrency does not use mining (proof-of-work) or minting (proof-of-stake). Rather, it uses an innovative consensus protocol dubbed proof-of-cooperation (PoC). In this system, blocks in the blockchain are generated by certified validation nodes (CVNs) which are certified and regulated by the FairCoop. There is no reward for this labor aside from the transaction fees. Overall control of the system is a collaboration between the system’s blockchain admins, the CVNs, and FairCoop community members. The admins vote and control CVN in line with the FairCoop assembly to ensure the production and security of the blockchain is done as democratically as possible. Community members trade and participate in decisions and direction through the FairCoop assembly.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">How Proof-of-Cooperation Works</h3>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The PoC consensus algorithm starts with all CVNs examining the blocks to determine which CVN should produce the next block. The chosen CVN has to be an active, certified node which produced a block the longest time ago.</li>
                            <li>The hash of the last, canonical block is verified, the CVN ID is assigned to create the next FairCoin block, and all other CVNs sign and transmit their decision to have the node from step 1 publish the next block.</li>
                            <li>Checks are made throughout the network of nodes to ensure it is time to create a new block in accordance with the dynamically established blockchain parameters.</li>
                            <li>At the appropriate time, the CVN assigned the task to generate the new block gathers the CVNs’ signatures from the most recently published block. This establishes provenance and threshold for that CVN to proceed with the new block, requiring a 50% consensus threshold at a minimum.</li>
                            <li>The new block is generated and transmitted to the entire network for validation.</li>
                            <li>If the CVN had enough signatures, it is very likely it will be accepted and published to the canonical blockchain.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Certified Validation Nodes</h3>
                    <p>There are strict guidelines for CVNs in the above processes. Like other blockchain systems, their job is to secure the network and to ensure blocks are published roughly every three minutes. This involves each node maintaining the most recent FairCoin core client software and a unique ID certified digitally by the FairCoop. CVNs must have:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>24/7 connection to the Internet</li>
                            <li>Usage of public NTP server to ensure synchronized node times</li>
                            <li>Correctly configured wallet software and FairCoop certificates</li>
                            <li>Smart card reader or FASITO device, issued by the FairCoin development team, which carries the CVN private keys (secured by a PIN). This device is returned to the development team if it becomes locked.</li>
                            <li>Vigilance of the decisions from the FairCoop assembly and the changes made to a NCP document regulating the core functionality of a CVN.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Blockchain Management</h3>
                    <p>Within the FairCoop system, publicly appointed blockchain administrators sign off on new instruction data for FairCoin which must be done by 5/8 of administrators within 3 minutes. The number of administrators is dynamic and stored on the blockchain. They are obliged to follow the directions of the FairCoop assembly as not doing so would result in their removal as a signing authority for future assembly dictates (all they can do is vote yes/no).</p>
                    <p>FairCoin blocks can hold:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Transactions</li>
                            <li>CVN information</li>
                            <li>Blockchain parameters</li>
                            <li>Administrator information</li>
                            <li>Coin supply instructions</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>CVNs are added and removed based on signed administrator decisions which are issued to the FairCoin network via the blockchain. The goal is to have greater than 20 certified CVNs operating at all times and any perceivable level of failure from a CVN can result in removal from the network. A minimum number of votes (5/8) can result in:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Add/remove of a CVN</li>
                            <li>Add/remove of administrator(s)</li>
                            <li>Update dynamic chain parameters</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>With version 2.0 of FairCoin, the FairCoin supply is intended to be fixed as the value established at the termination of version 1.0. However, FairCoin can be burned to create return transactions. The number of allowed coins can only be increased during a hard fork, but this feature is not used in the canonical FairCoin. Forks only occur if all administrators vote to do so.</p>
                    <p>The FairCoop sees FairCoin primarily as a store-of-value for the FairCoop paradigm. This extends to FairCoin’s potential utility in micro-payment systems, facilitating distributed sub-chains, and a common medium for a multi-currency ecosystem. By shifting away from PoW and PoS as consensus algorithms, FairCoin bolsters a low-power, secure, non-competitive, and quick store-of-value that is also ethical, flexible, and committed to global cooperatives, community, and democratic values. Potential use-cases for FairCoin are many:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Merchants accepting FairCoin (useFairCoin)</li>
                            <li>Self-employed services (FreedomCoop)</li>
                            <li>Sell goods/services (FairMarket)</li>
                            <li>Personal Savings (FairSaving)</li>
                            <li>Donations (FairStarts, CoopFunding, FairFunds)</li>
                            <li>Local Exchange Trade Schemes</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">FairCoop Ecosystem</h2>
                    <p>As discussed above, FairCoin has been strategically adopted by FairCoop for a number of goals. One of the first goals you are acquainted with is to exclude governments and central banks. In the context of the website, the perception is that they see these vertical institutions as lethargic and unable to foster equitable knowledge work/access, equitable work-time, and growing of collective/cooperative economies. Other goals include:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Establishing a global north/south economic balance (they wrote restore, but there was never equality politically or economically between the two)</li>
                            <li>Enhance global cooperation, common good, and economic justice</li>
                            <li>Use FairCoin in some way for all FairCoop goals</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>To this end, FairCoin is intended to act as the medium of exchange, store-of-value, and reference value for other economic mechanisms in the FairCoop ecosystem (e.g., FairCredit, FairFunds, FairSaving, FairBag (user backup), FairNetwork, merchant rates, FairMarket, multi-currency exchange). In effect, the overarching strategy is to shift away from existing, hegemonic systems. In order to sustain dialogue within and between communities, committees exist for general matters, economic direction, and social extensions of these system. In addition to committees that can be stood up for any subject at any time, there are three main funds that the FairCoop promotes (which are also related to their primary organizational goals):</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Global South Fund</li>
                            <li>Commons Fund</li>
                            <li>Technology Infrastructure Fund</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>These funds exist because FairCoop’s promotion of FairCoin:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Signifies struggle against global financial systems dominated by “1%”</li>
                            <li>Struggles against economic inequalities</li>
                            <li>Promotes decentralization of organizational forms</li>
                            <li>Fostering/production of the commons</li>
                            <li>Sharing and distribution of open knowledge</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>These principles/conceptual frameworks are woven into the above agenda:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Integral revolution</li>
                            <li>“Peer-to-peer”</li>
                            <li>Cryptocurrencies</li>
                            <li>Free and open knowledge</li>
                            <li>Hacker ethics</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>To these ends, FairCoin is more so seen as a tool/framework than as a monetary model by FairCoop (or committees within FairNetwork). Prior to shifting to PoC, FairCoin was a PoS/PoW hybrid system (based on Bitcoin as an alt-coin framework). Following an initial supply of 50 Million FAIR (the primary denomination of FairCoin) being distributed to the FairCoin network (under the PoS/PoW protocol version 1.0), saving of the coins was incentivized through a system of diminishing award to the minters/miners (6% received to active nodes in the first year followed by 3% the second and 1% for all following years). The aim of this was to boost the store-of-value aspect of FairCoin, ultimately bolstering the FairCoop ecosystem initiatives.</p>
                    <p>These efforts are largely the result of a small group of people. As of 2014, the Catalan Integral Cooperative (CIC), P2P Foundation for Alternatives, and Dark Wallet have supported FairCoop’s growth with Enric Duran as a key figure head within the FairCoop community (he is/was one of the key people to fund, through donation, the funds mentioned above). These efforts fall largely under the aim to bolster open cooperativism:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Retrieval of property as common wealth under popular possession/control</li>
                            <li>Building cooperative and self-managed public system based on mutual supported</li>
                            <li>Free access to information and knowledge</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>To these ends, social organization is critical. Ergo, local nodes are the grassroots-based foundation of FairCoop facilitating the cyclical flows to and from local and global scales of political economy. These are organizations with no less than 3 members (individuals and/or organizations; prefer at least 6 members with 10-12+ members as optimal for a local node) who are charged with these FairCoop- and FairNetwork-based tasks:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bring in new FairCoop members through promotion/evangelization</li>
                            <li>Organize FairCoop-focused workshops, talks, interviews</li>
                            <li>Connect FairCoop to local events</li>
                            <li>Get involved in global action, taking charge at local level</li>
                            <li>Take part in getFairCoin, FairPay, FairMarket exchange economy</li>
                            <li>Support FreedomCoop members</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>These, per direction of FairCoop, have to be open and transparent in nature. Funding for local nodes occurs 2 to 3 months after their establishment at which time they are able to redistribute FreedomCoop funds, exchange FairCoin in the local economy, and receive funding from FairCoop's major funds.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Internal Economics of FairCoop</h3>
                    <p>Keep in mind, all economic activity within FairCoop is done in FairCoin. This is closely tied the internal economics of the proposed FairCoop ecosystem.</p>
                    <blockquote>“FairCoop has a political framework for management of the commons based on working economic commissions and councils, as well as spaces for participation and digital direct democracy, in terms of policy decision“</blockquote>
                    <p>Therefore, the ecosystem councils:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Decide the cost of the pool funding that is shared with FairNetwork</li>
                            <li>Decide where the funds go based on issuance of transactions for commission planning/costs</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>The sources of these funds are largely gathered through FairMarket (FairCoin purchases) and input from FairCredit (which is still an emerging system).</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">FairCoin Projects</h3>
                    <p>We have already largely mentioned most of the projects that fall under FairCoop in varying amounts of detail. However, it is necessary to examine each project in their own rights as they both bolster and expose issues within the larger FairCoop ecosystem.</p>
