                    <p>This blog is based on a paper I drafted in the spring of this year. My goal was to draw out the social dimensions of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. In recent months, this has become part of my PhD project. Though far from complete, this is my first look at the social processes surrounding illicit activity as facilitated in part by the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In was mid-afternoon in San Francisco when Ross Ulbricht took a seat in the Glen Park Library (Bearman et al., 2015). Even though this was not his typical café working spot, he quickly opened his laptop and began to feverishly administer his website. Like many public libraries, there were several people around including many homeless patrons. Early into his work, an argument had broken out between two people right behind him. When Ross turned around in reaction to this incident, he was immediately tackled and handcuffed while another person took his laptop away, quickly accessing his system for information.</p>
                    <p>Ross Ulbricht was perceived by his friends and family as a hard working currency trader and entrepreneur, but online he had a very different persona: Dread Pirate Roberts. That day in the library, Ulbricht was arrested by the FBI for running what was at the time the largest online illicit materials market in the world: Silk Road. For almost two years, the FBI and other agencies had been working to expose the leadership and identities of people using and facilitating this digital marketplace of which Dread Pirate Roberts was their primary objective (Bearman et al., 2015). The proceeding shutdown of the first Silk Road marketplace was largely the result of examining the activity of servers, personal computers, and people themselves. However, it was an understanding and leveraging of the social network surrounding Dread Pirate Roberts that led to the arrest of Ulbricht and others major actors within the Silk Road marketplace.</p>
                    <p>This use of social networks to identify and capture criminals is common practice in modern police work (Burcher & Whelan, 2015; Tayebi & Uwe, 2016). However, as the spaces of online communication and data exchange become more complex, the methods and practices of digital forensics become more difficult to access with their applicational ramifications difficult to comprehend. This is perhaps why the activity found within the Bitcoin blockchain has only been seen as a record of exchange rather than as an artifact of the social relations of the Silk Road marketplace itself.</p>
                    <p>This study seeks to examine the aspects of social capital surrounding Dread Pirate Roberts through the following research question:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In examination of the Bitcoin blockchain and known addresses used by Dread Pirate Roberts, can actor and group level benefits be established within the context of Dread Pirate Robert’s Silk Road transactions between 2011 and late 2013?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>This research question will be expanded on through these sub-questions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>How can social capital of particular relations primarily assessed via Bitcoin addresses connected to Dread Pirate Roberts be validated by known identities as found through the BitcoinWhosWho API and the Blockchain.info API?</li>
                            <li>What does the use of Bitcoin as the standard unit of currency for Silk Road tell us about the forms of social capital found within the social relations of Dread Pirate Roberts?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>This study concludes with an assessment of Bitcoin as a byproduct of a particular array of social relations that guide its economic applications.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Bitcoin and Blockchains</h2>
                    <p>A key factor in the case against Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road was the use of heavy encryption and identity protection via the Onion Router (TOR) network and the cryptocurrency Bitcoin (Jardine, 2015). Despite the nature of the Bitcoin blockchain as public and transparent, one can not simply look at the record of Bitcoin transactions to determine who purchased what from whom. This aspect of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system is what made its application within the Silk Road marketplace optimal between 2011 and late 2013. In order to better understand the importance of the Bitcoin blockchain for the purpose of this study, we will examine the brief history of Bitcoin and the mechanisms that drive blockchain technologies.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheading">History of Bitcoin</h2>
                    <p>In late 2008, a software developer using the name Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a distributed, peer-to-peer (P2P) currency system named Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008). By early 2009, the Bitcoin network was active and producing currency for the community (using their computers to run and support the burgeoning network). This new system was rooted in existing technologies such as cryptographically secured e-money of the 1980s (e.g., DigiCash) (Peters et al., 2015), P2P data sharing networks of the late 1970s (e.g., BitTorrent), and more ubiquitous publicly available cryptography of the early 1990s (e.g., PGP). By 2010, Mt. Gox had emerged as one the largest Bitcoin exchanges handling massive volumes of Bitcoin transactions and trades (until its hack and collapse in 2014) (Glaser et al., 2014). These exchanges were also some of the first to re-introduce mediation into a system built to eliminate economic intermediaries.</p>
                    <p>Around this time, the Bitcoin core developers took over the development of Bitcoin software from Nakamoto, who stepped away from public discourse in late 2010. This led to ongoing debates among developers and community members on necessary changes to the Bitcoin protocol and the politics within which this technology should be used and sustained in practice. Such debates have recently led to splits in the community such as the creation of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold in 2017 (Akhtar, 2017). These changes were and are driven as much by politics and social dynamics as they were by discourse regarding technological shifts in the protocol (Golumbia, 2015). Early adopters of these technologies ranged from those that were libertarian, right-wing, anti-government, anti-regulation, or extremist to those holding anarchist, cypherpunk, hacker, or criminal views for which a pseudo-anonymous, non-human regulated currency system would greatly appeal (Golumbia, 2015). This diversity of users and advocates has only increased over time.</p>
                    <p>Bitcoin first gained broad notoriety with the funding of Wikileaks in June of 2011 (Halaburda & Sarvary, 2015). This occurred in the wake of large financial institutes refusing to complete donations made to Wikileaks following the publication of thousands of classified US military documents, leaving digital currencies like Bitcoin the most viable solution to fund the Wikileaks organization. Then in 2013, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed to $1200 USD by November shortly after the arrest of Ross Ulbricht and the shutdown of Silk Road (Halaburda & Sarvary, 2015).</p>
                    <p>To further explain how these shifts in the technology are made possible through a fusion of technical knowledge, political ideology, and social relations, we will now examine the fundamentals of the underlying blockchain technology.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheading">Blockchain Technologies</h2>
                    <p>As mentioned above, Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies are made possible via their underlying blockchain technologies. At the most basic level, blockchain technology is comprised of three core technologies: the blockchain; a distributed network of miners or minters; and some form of strong cryptography. The blockchain is essentially a canonical database in which all the transactions performed on the Bitcoin network are stored and verified by the network. This is different from an ordinary database in that it is distributed across a global network of computers who are all running the same software; this software implements a form of consensus-based algorithmic governance that regulates the canonical database (Amoore, 2011; Danaher et al., 2017).</p>
                    <p>The distributed network of computers are called miners within Bitcoin (other blockchain systems will call their computer nodes minters based on the form of algorithmic governance). These miners are essentially high-performance computers whose sole function is to run the Bitcoin mining software, allowing them to compete in publication of blocks to the blockchain. Blocks are essentially collections of Bitcoin transactions that are gathered approximately every ten minutes. Once these transactions are gathered and each miner node has created its version of the block, they compete based on a competitive benchmark established by the entire network in order to maintain the ten minute pace of block publication on average. The miners compete by attempting to produce a hash value (an algorithmic output of random characters for a given data input) that is nearly identical to the competitive benchmark (called the nonce). When a miner finds a value that equals the nonce, the value is verified by the network and the miner can then publish its version of the block to the blockchain. The miner is then rewarded with Bitcoin for it “proof-of-work” (which is the name given to Bitcoins particular form of consensus-based algorithmic governance). Miners may also agree to work together by combining their collective compute power in what are known as mining pools. Furthermore, there are also mining farms that are massive mining operations.</p>
                    <p>Bitcoin also requires a third element: strong encryption. Transactions could not occur nor miners compete without public and private key combinations better know as wallets (based on the concepts of PGP, or “pretty good privacy” encryption, such as SHA256). These wallets act as a user’s identity on the blockchain (more specifically, their public key). Users must also sign any transaction on the network with a combination of their public key, their private key, and the public key of the wallet to which they are sending Bitcoin. For miners, encryption is used to produce hashes, to compete against the nonce for publication of blocks, and to store any rewards from successful publication of a block. Encryption also serves another purpose in that it preserves the validity of the blockchain through a provenance of hash values (or hash trees). This means that a hash of every block prior to the most recent one is a required element in any new block being generated by the network. This process is persistently verified by the miners in the process of publishing blocks to the one, canonical blockchain.</p>
                    <p>In an ideal world, this system of interactions between the blockchain, wallets, and miners (known as the blockchain protocol) would work perpetually with little issues. However, people drive the volume and types of transactions from outside of this protocol. In return, miners decide what software their mining computers will run which dictates which protocol they support and for which protocol they compete. Miners will often choose their protocol based on the most lucrative cryptocurrency being produced. This is due to the massive amount of energy and high turn over of computer equipment consumed by most proof-of-work mining processes. Since the security and validity of a blockchain is heightened with an increased number of users and miners (and therefore, in part, the value of the cryptocurrency), it behooves the developers of the Bitcoin software to make changes that appease the majority of both users and miners in the current network. If users or miners dislike a change (or even a proposed change), they can opt to hard fork the blockchain.</p>
                    <p>A hard fork occurs when nodes cannot validate new blocks on the blockchain that other upgraded miner nodes can (as compared to a soft fork where miners using older software can validate new blocks). This, in effect, creates two blockchains. This fork is a permanent divergence from the canonical blockchain. Keep in mind that this is a decision and effect driven by human decisions influenced by any combination of political or social rationale shared within varying communities. Miscione et al. (2017) points to a certain tribal governance that emerges for the approaches people take in their application of blockchain technologies. I propose an extension to this concept in stating that it is perhaps divergences within sub-groups of miners that cause the dilemmas faced during hard fork events.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheading">Value of Bitcoin</h2>
                    <p>The value of Bitcoin is still debatable almost ten years after its conception. Despite its current condition as store-of-value for other cryptocurrencies (or alt-coins), it has yet to reach a critical mass as a monetary exchange medium that is easily accessed and utilized by a globally distributed user-base. Due to the massive size of the Bitcoin blockchain and the increasing number of transactions, latency and scale of transactions continue to be issues developers rush to solve. In addition to latency and scale (Kobusinska et al., 2016), volatility in exchange value of Bitcoin (for USD, Euro, etc.) is another risk factor deterring broader adoption of the cryptocurrency (Garcia, 2015). This is often coupled with the lack of existing vendors who accept Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies). Furthermore, Kim et al. (2017) supports Garcia’s (2015) assessment that volatility can in part be attributed to opinions and information expressed via social media. Therefore, Burn (2014) states, like many others, that Bitcoin is not nearly as important as the underlying blockchain technology that gave it life.</p>
                    <p>These problematics have led many to ask if Bitcoin, in and of itself, has any real worth despite is massive multi-billion dollar market cap (Luther, 2018). As Mai et al. (2017) state, there is a correlation between social media posts and Bitcoin price fluctuation that may suggest that holders of the cryptocurrency, once engaged with the system, can have a potentially large effect (especially respected figures and community leaders who post on social media with positive sentiment). Xie et al. (2017) continue this line of thought in stating that network structure is the key to understanding how social media affects the financial aspects of Bitcoin. This would support claims made by Teigland et al. (2013) that the Bitcoin open-source community may be considered as a potential “institutional entrepreneur” through which formal and informal organization of smaller network structures enact divergent changes within the larger community.</p>
                    <p>The value of Bitcoin is therefore ultimately defined by the social relations that enact its use and foster its agreed upon form of exchange. In the case of Silk Road, the libertarian politics associate with drug use as an individual choice was mobilized through the implementation of Bitcoin as the standard of exchange for community members. Combined with the use of TOR, this led to the growth of numerous networks within the larger Silk Road community ranging from casual drug users to global dealer networks of weapons and hackers-for-hire. This may indicate that particular individuals or groups in these networks became nodes with extremely high social capital, such as Dread Pirate Roberts.</p>
