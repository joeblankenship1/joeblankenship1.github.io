			<p>Within the steadily evolving idea of digital minimalism, the question of whether “less is more” has drawn heated debate. Some argue that access to technology can assist in areas of education, employment, and collective action. In this way, local communities can be given opportunities and a voice through which to mobilize their social and political discourses on multiple scales. However, others argue that the increasing presence of digital technologies and ease of access to particular forms of knowledge have created certain forms of educational dependencies, digital barriers to employment, and new means through which isolated communities are lost within the growing amounts of global data flows. Cal Newport, the author of Digital Minimalism, suggests that technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad and that it should be used to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you. According to this view, we have a choice to disconnect and to engage with technology as we see fit, regardless of what society expects of our engagement, access, or connectivity. Therefore, the issue is whether to continue our daily dependency and immersion in our technologies or to find a way to minimize our access and dependency through modification of our daily routines and activities.</p>
			<p>I argue that this concept of “minimalism” is one of extreme privilege that can be afforded to only a select few in the world. I do admit that the advantages that come with mitigating one’s dependencies on technology do improve certain aspects of daily life, but I still maintain that even in the United States, digital minimalism is largely untenable for many people. In my time attempting digital minimalism, I ran into issues of access and connectivity that affected my ability to learn, work, and to secure my online activities. Some may object to this in saying there are ways to cope with these challenges of access by merely reducing the time spent on our technologies which will then result in us eventually being more efficient with what little access we do allow ourselves. However, as I found out, reduction of use combined with limited access in the United States not only proves difficult, but reflects large issues of digital divide in many parts of the world. This is important as many younger generations take for granted the free Wi-Fi and high-speed mobile data access that so many others don’t have. What we should be doing instead of minimizing our use is to make sure that our time is spent using that access to help others without such advantages, valuing other’s lives as much as we do our own.</p>
			
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
		    <p>In early 2019, I decided to perform a little experiment. The intent of this experiment was to see how much impact having no Internet in my home would have on my daily activities. At first, I was very excited to do this as I was often distracted with building new tools and exploring new data sets, ultimately keeping me from working on my writing as much as I felt I should be. I started by removing the cable internet from my house, renting co-work space, and depending solely on a limited amount of tether available through my smartphone. However, throughout the month, I found that I went to the co-work very little due to my weekly work schedule. This left me with high-speed Internet (speeds of 30Mbps or more) only when I was at work and with 3G speeds (or slower) at any other time.</p>
		    <p>At first, this did help with my productivity. I was reading and writing more than I had in previous months as I had to plan my online activity in advance for my time offline. I also found myself getting up more, working out, and getting outside of my office and home. However, outside of this initial boost there were some significant drawbacks. Accessing some websites was brutally slow, downloading data and system updates took forever, and using security practices I have previously used was no longer possible. For this, I went in search of solutions to these matters.</p>
		    <p>Upon searching for solutions to slow- or no-access issues to websites and data, I found myself reading comments from people in more rural parts of the US and from those in countries outside of North America and Europe. After reading several threads and blog posts, there were many people who had made the move to minimize their digital dependencies who very quickly went back to their old ways. Whether this was due to social pressure of social network involvement, access to their online classes, or need to stay connected to work e-mail, they often commented that  they would spend hours in cafes and offices taking care of things they would ordinarily take care of at home or through their smartphones. Outside of the Western context, the stories were far worse. People who had some connection to the Internet often found themselves as competitive disadvantages with others in job searches. This would often be accompanied with painful stories of how they obtained their education of software development or data analysis over the course of years through extremely slow Internet connections (one story remarking that it took 20 minutes for them to log into their MOOC website from their location). It seemed that in an era of burgeoning 5G speeds, much of the world was still struggling to connect on a daily basis.</p>
		    <p>In the process of resolving my minimal shift with the necessity to accomplish daily tasks, I came across three main issues that plagued me and several others.</p>
