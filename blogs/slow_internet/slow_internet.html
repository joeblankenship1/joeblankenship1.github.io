			<p>Within the steadily evolving idea of digital minimalism, the question of whether “less is more” has drawn heated debate. Some argue that access to technology can assist in areas of education, employment, and collective action. In this way, local communities can be given opportunities and a voice through which to mobilize their social and political discourses on multiple scales. However, others argue that the increasing presence of digital technologies and ease of access to particular forms of knowledge have created certain forms of educational dependencies, digital barriers to employment, and new means through which isolated communities are lost within the growing amounts of global data flows. Cal Newport, the author of Digital Minimalism, suggests that technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad and that it should be used to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you. According to this view, we have a choice to disconnect and to engage with technology as we see fit, regardless of what society expects of our engagement, access, or connectivity. Therefore, the issue is whether to continue our daily dependency and immersion in our technologies or to find a way to minimize our access and dependency through modification of our daily routines and activities.</p>
			<p>I argue that this concept of “minimalism” is one of extreme privilege that can be afforded to only a select few in the world. I do admit that the advantages that come with mitigating one’s dependencies on technology do improve certain aspects of daily life, but I still maintain that even in the United States, digital minimalism is largely untenable for many people. In my time attempting digital minimalism, I ran into issues of access and connectivity that affected my ability to learn, work, and to secure my online activities. Some may object to this in saying there are ways to cope with these challenges of access by merely reducing the time spent on our technologies which will then result in us eventually being more efficient with what little access we do allow ourselves. However, as I found out, reduction of use combined with limited access in the United States not only proves difficult, but reflects large issues of digital divide in many parts of the world. This is important as many younger generations take for granted the free Wi-Fi and high-speed mobile data access that so many others don’t have. What we should be doing instead of minimizing our use is to make sure that our time is spent using that access to help others without such advantages, valuing other’s lives as much as we do our own.</p>
